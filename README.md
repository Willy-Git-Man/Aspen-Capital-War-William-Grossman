#Aspen-Capital-War-William-Grossman
Play-War is an application where users can sign up then play other existing players and compete to get to the top of the leader board. 

* Live Site
Link to the live version of [Play-War](https://play-war.herokuapp.com/), hosted by Heroku.

* Tech
Play War is built on the following technologies

Backend - Express on Node.js

Frontend - React/Redux, Javascript

Database - PostgresSQL, Sequelize

Styling - HTML, CSS

* Features
The current version of the site has the following fully implemented features

* Full user authentication
Users can securely sign up and log back into accounts, passwords are hashed securely using BCrypt and are stored as such in the database

* Full access to other users for the purpose of playing and competing
Users can play any other player who has signed up

* Leaderboard stored in a database
All games are recorded and stored in a database so players can compete for the title of #1 War player in the universe (as it pertains to my application)

* Hosted on Heroku
The application is live so that users can connect and play online


* Installation
To install and start playing War, follow the instructions below:
Git clone: https://github.com/Willy-Git-Man/Aspen-Capital-War-William-Grossman.git
* Backend Dependencies:
  "dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.6",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "csurf": "^1.11.0",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.0",
    "express": "^4.17.2",

  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "dotenv-cli": "^4.1.1",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.15"
  }
Run npm install
Install postgres: https://www.postgresql.org/download/ (Homebrew cmd: brew install postgresql)
Create a new user in postgresQl with CREATEDB and PASSWORD in PSQL
    -CREATE USER <username> WITH CREATEDB PASSWORD <'password'>
  
    * Create a .env file (
PORT=5000
DB_USERNAME=war_user
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DATABASE=war_database
DB_HOST=localhost
JWT_SECRET=secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=604800
  
  The proxy is set to PORT 5000, change it to your desired port if necessary
  
   * Run npx dotenv sequelize db:create
  * Run npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate
  * Run npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all


Add the following scripts to package.json in the backend for easy database control:
    "sequelize": "sequelize",
    "sequelize-cli": "sequelize-cli",
    "start": "per-env",
    "start:development": "nodemon -r dotenv/config ./bin/www",
    "start:production": "node ./bin/www",
    "db:migrate": "dotenv sequelize-cli db:migrate",
    "db:migrate:undo:all": "dotenv sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all",
    "db:redo": "npm run db:seed:undo:all && npm run db:migrate:undo:all && npm run db:migrate && npm run db:seed:all",
    "db:seed:all": "dotenv sequelize-cli db:seed:all",
    "db:seed:undo:all": "dotenv sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all",
    "db:drop": "dotenv sequelize-cli db:drop",
    "db:create": "dotenv sequelize-cli db:create",
    "db:reset": "npm run db:drop && npm run db:create && npm run db:migrate && npm run db:seed:all"
  
  The last script will drop,create,migrate,and seed the database by itself
  
  Run 'npm i react-icons' in the front end for access to the Github and LinkedIn Icons/Links

I made some tradeoffs as I built the application and I will outline what I would have liked to do and how I ended up spending my time below: 


I would have spent time writing tests for backend, I wrote try catches and error handlers which served me well and wanted to write jest tests though did not have the time

I would have made the front end much more appealing

I would have made a better shuffle algorithm, and designed better logic for the game. I was surprised to run into things like endless loops if the deck isn't shuffled, and a variety of other deck related scenarios

I would have made a better Read.me. I am not proud of how it turned out

I would have written a better function to generate the entire game. I wrote one that basically flips a coin so you can see the database working without playing an entire game of war and did not have time to write it so it would render every hand

I would have liked to make the game much more appealing, in the end I didn't have time to swap out the face cards so you'll notice 11,12,13,14 rather than Jack,Queen,King,Ace

I would have liked to make the code much cleaner, I had enough time to finish the app and get everything hosted but not enough time to go back and make everything as DRY as I could have 

I would have liked to write an algorithm for various dilemmas that occur during the game, I did my best to make due with the time I had make the game play as close to real War as possible though I realized throughout the build that some scenarios took many game iterations to come to the surface

I would have liked to add docker, that was another quick thing I put off until the end then ran out of time

User Auth took longer than expected, I am not sure secure authorization was the best idea but I thought that players being able to securely sign up and play with each other would be a great feature. Unfortunately it may have taken 25-30% of my time.

Getting the redux store set up took longer than expected particularly when it came to updating wins in real time. I think that redux makes an application speed feel near magic and if I could do it again I would have built the app first without it then added it. 

I spent a lot of time on the game logic, more than anticipated. It's truly one of those things that makes me appreciate the human brain. It seems like an easy concept but it's analogous to knowing the fastest way home. We all do it but it's much harder to write a traversal algorithm than it is to remember how not to get home.

With more time it would have been how I imagined and hoped it would be, though I underestimated how long putting the entire app together would take and in regards to the things I didnâ€™t have time for that was my biggest downfall. 
  
  
  Finally create an account or log into the demo user to join the online sensation that is sweeping the nation
  
  Thank you for considering me for the postion I hope the installation was smooth,
  William
